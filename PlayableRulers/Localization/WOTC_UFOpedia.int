DescriptionEntry="The Viper King is theorized to be the most intelligent ruler--not only because he managed to escape by his own, but also for being able to assemble a whole Viper \'civilization\' by himself. His instincts guided him to build up a force of his kin that he would try to rally against the Elders. He was like us in that he wanted to disrupt the Elders' control against his people, so one of his first actions was against an ADVENT facility. Unfortunately for the na√Øve King, this was a trap set up by some moles in his forces--and he ended up captured. Sometime after a chip was put in him, he ended up in Vahlen's hands. \n We're theorizing that it was through the chip, but the king took his Viper 'consorts' and ambushed Vahlen in and tried to assassinate her. That failed thanks to Big Sky and a few other members of her crew, giving her the opportunity to escape along with the few surviving members.\n He, nonetheless, pressed his attack and took over the lab, \'liberating\' the remaining rulers. In the end, the Viper King settled down in his old habitat and reclaimed the lab as his new base of operations where he continued to build and grow his army and power, until his eventual encounter with XCOM.\n It's well known what happened there--he fought XCOM and lost, and the strain of the fight broke the chip in his head so he could think more clearly. Despite XCOM agents killing some of his offspring, the Viper King blamed this on ADVENT as they were the ones who set him up like this; he never meant to be hostile towards humanity. After learning the full truth about his captivity and eventual control that the Elders exerted onto his people, he \'swore vengeance\' and offered an alliance to XCOM.\n Liberated and infused with a new sense of purpose, the Viper King now leads his Vipers against ADVENT and the Ethereals as a whole. Even if that means that he has to fight against its own enslaved kind, he is still determined to achieve his goals and bring justice to the Elders.\n\n - Bradford."
